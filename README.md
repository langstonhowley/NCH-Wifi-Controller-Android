# NCH Wifi Controller (For Android)

This Android application allows users to connect to a Nextek NCH and toggle its wifi.

More specifically, a virtual serial port is made between the device and a user-selected NCH using the Bluetooth RFCOMM Protocol (more information on RFCOMM [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#RFCOMM)). This allows for the user to toggle wifi by sending byte data through the serial port.
